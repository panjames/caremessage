		<p class=story-hero>Healthcare is at a tipping point. Unprecedented efforts are being made to improve health outcomes and foster efficiencies in healthcare delivery. What seems promising with the current reform and transformation efforts is the convergence of existing mass markets influencing healthcare innovation. <a href="#mobile-story"><span class=serif-ital>Continue Reading ›</span></a></p>

<p class=story>For example, leveraging mobile phones to track, monitor, and engage patients in lifestyle and self-health management. Mobile text messaging communication in particular has proven to be an effective way to foster desired behavior change in patients and improve the way in which care is delivered by capturing important data that is actionable. </p>

<p class=story>The need for improving outcomes and creating efficiency becomes increasingly important in the context of the coverage expansion in the Affordable Care Act where millions of Americans will enter the system, utilizing more healthcare resources. In particular, the Medicaid expansion is projected to result in a total of 75.6 million enrollees for 2014, an increase of roughly 19.5 million as a result of the ACA. Leveraging mobile text message communication to facilitate convenient and efficient communication among patients and providers, as well encouraging desired behavior change by providing patients with educational tools to improve health outcomes, is encouraging to achieve on the triple-aim objective of healthcare reform. </p>

<p class=story>caremessage aims to change healthcare delivery for disadvantaged populations by pioneering the effort of mobile technology as a way to improve access to critical health information and effective self-care management. A June 2013 Pew Research report estimated mobile phone penetration at 86% among American households earning less than $30,000 per year. This compares to 59% of the same demographic who have access to a desktop or laptop, and 47% who have broadband set-up at home. These figures imply a greater potential of mobile health innovations to accelerate adoption compared to other technology approaches for this demographic.</p>

<p class=story>The opportunities to innovate using mobile technologies among the low-income and underserved populations are robust. A review of several research publications as well as surveying key constituents within the healthcare ecosystem serving these populations, it is clear that the unmet needs plaguing the healthcare safety-net and contributing to waste include poor appointment attendance, poor medication adherence, and poor health literacy.</p> 

<p class=story>Extending the successes of current mobile text message patient engagement strategies to each of these unmet needs has the potential to reduce waste and inefficiencies in the system by improving health literacy and self-health management of low-income and underserved populations. This paper intends to review studies and analyze the implications of using text messaging as a way to encourage patient behavior change. It also will include a discussion on Caremessage’s data collection strategy to evaluate the impact of the technology and inform product development. </p>

<h2 class=story-heading>SMS for Appointment Reminders</h2>

<p class=story>Patients failing to attend their scheduled doctor visits contribute to inefficiencies and misused resources. In general it is found that a reminder, whether it be by text or phone, is helpful in improving attendance, however SMS technology is a more cost-effective approach.</p>

<p class=story>A 2012 study analyzing the effect of SMS text reminders to reduce nonattendance for hospital outpatient visits found a significant difference in the attendance rate of patients who received a text reminder compared to patients who received no reminder. The study was conducted at ITS-CDSR in the Departments of Prosthodontics, Endodontics, Orthodontics and Paedodontics through the Department of Public Health and Dentistry in India. Patients who had a mobile phone number on record were enrolled in the text message reminders, totaling 206 participants compared to 110 in the control group (patients receiving no reminder). The study was conducted across the departments for a period of 4 months. The results concluded that the attendance rate for patients who received text message reminders over the 4 month period were significantly higher (79.2%) compared to the attendance rate of those who received no reminder (35.5%).</p>

<h2 class=story-heading>SMS for Medication Reminders</h2>

<p class=story>Patients’ failure to adhere to their medication regimen can lead to unnecessary disease progression and complications. This contributes to waste in the healthcare system including preventable visits to the emergency room and increased utilization of other healthcare resources. Researchers have evaluated the impact of SMS text reminders on promoting medication adherence. The results are promising, suggesting text as an efficient and effective way to ensure patients take their medication.</p>

<p class=story>The American Heart Association found that text message reminders improved the medication adherence of patients who were recovering from a heart attack. The study included 90 patients over a 30 day period. The patients were divided into three groups: one received two medication reminders daily along with educational tips, the second group only received educational tips, and the third group received no messages at all. The results show that the group who received both reminders and tips had an 88% rate of correct prescription adherence compared to 72% of the patients who received no texts at all. The group who received the heart-healthy tips had a 95% rate of adherence. </p>

<h2 class=story-heading>SMS for Education</h2>

<p class=story>SMS text-based education is emerging as an effective way to engage patients in better self-care. Lack of education around basic health information leads to approximately $106 billion to $238 billion in economic burden each year18.  Text message outreach with educational content can be an efficient way to improve patients’ health literacy.</p>

<p class=story>The Center for Connected Health in Boston reported in a study that text messaging improved treatment adherence and self-care for dermatology patients suffering from atopic dermatitis19. In the study, 25 patients received daily text messages over a period of six weeks. The text messages included treatment reminders and educational content pertaining to their health condition. At the end of the six week study, patients reported and improvement of treatment adherence of 72% and roughly 68% of the patients reported an improvement in self-care behaviors to help their conditions.

<h2 class=story-heading>Conclusions</h2>

<p class=story>Mobile text communication can be a cost-efficient and effective way to engage patients in the desired behavior change to improve appointment attendance, medication adherence, and self-care management of disease. As the healthcare system transitions to a focus on improving health outcomes, engaging patients in the management of their health is critical. SMS text messaging is a low-cost way to facilitate engagement and enhance the health literacy of individuals living with chronic conditions and other health challenges.</p>
