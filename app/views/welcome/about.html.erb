<h3 class=title>User Interface Designer</h3>
<p class=bio>Hi, I'm James. Since I'm the creative guy, you'll notice that I'm the odd one out writing this in the first person. At CareMessage, I do all the creative stuff — user interfaces/experience, visual design, and almost all the photos you see here on the website (I hiked up Twin Peaks... in a suit to grab the picture you see above!). I believe that design has the power to change medicine and healthcare as it is essentially a study of how we communicate.</p>
<p class=bio>I enjoy photography, EDM, and in my spare time, I attend medical school at Stanford University. Fun fact, I'm blessed with the useless ability to make latte art.</p>
